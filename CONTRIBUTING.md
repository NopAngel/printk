## CONTRIBUTING

These are the rules for collaborating on this project:

### How to create your PR?

- Try to include images, evidence, or official documentation: for the language (in this case, Rust).

- Try formatting your Rust code using `cargo fmt` before submitting your PR.

- Try writing your commits in the format I use (OPTIONAL, as this can be changed from within the PR, but it's recommended).
